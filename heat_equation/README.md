# Heat equation

The numerical solution of the heat equation was implemented using the finite difference method, similar to the approach used in the [wave equation simulation](../wave_equation/README.md) and [diffusion simulation](../diffusion/README.md) sections of this repository. I used the *jit compiler* **numba** to speed up the computation.
