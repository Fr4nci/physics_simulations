# Interesting Cases of the Laplace/Poisson Equation

This repository contains scripts and notes I've developed during my studies on the Laplace and Poisson equations. Here, you'll find various applications and examples illustrating the concepts.

### Current Projects:
- ~~Potential in a region of space with two conductors, with potentials \( V_0 \) and 0 on their surfaces~~
- Breakdown of the dielectric
- Laplace equation with arbitrary boundary counditions
- More cases to come
